Project 1: Improving Item-Item Similarity Estimation during Collaborative
Filtering

Project 2: A Technique for Inter-Retailer Recommendations

## Summary

### Project 1

This project explores the problem of inaccurate item-item similarity estimates
due to a lack of data within the context of collaborative filtering. Two novel
item-item similarity algorithms are implemented that leverage large sets of
user-item rating data. The first is based on a model of noisy similarity score
generation and is effective at estimating both future Pearson correlations and
cosine similarities. The second models noisy ratings as generated by similarity
score dependent distributions. Using the notion of user-predictvity, accurate
estimates of future Pearson correlation are made. See report.pdf for details.

### Project 2

This project explores the problem of making recommendations across retailers
using only publicly available information. Several inter-retailer recommender
algorithms are implemented along with an off-line experiment that compares the
performance of each algorithm using real data. A novel latent feature
recommender is implemented that leverages public intra-retailer recommendation
information. See report2.pdf for details.
